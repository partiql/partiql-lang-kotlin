/**
 * Here's a simple implementation of FULL OUTER JOIN. The idea is fairly straightforward:
 * Iterate through LHS. For each iteration of the LHS, iterate through RHS. Now, check the condition.
 * - If the condition passes, return the merged record (equivalent to result of INNER JOIN)
 * - If the condition does not pass, we need a way to return two records (one where the LHS is padded with nulls, and
 *   one where the RHS is padded with nulls). How we do this:
 *   - We maintain the [previousLhs] and [previousRhs]. If they are null, we then compute the next LHS and RHS. We
 *     store their values in-memory. Then we return a merged Record where the LHS is padded and the RHS is not (equivalent
 *     to result of RIGHT OUTER JOIN).
 *   - If they aren't null, then we pad the RHS with NULLS (we assume we've already padded the LHS) and return (equivalent
 *     to result of LEFT OUTER JOIN). We also make sure [previousLhs] and [previousRhs] are now null.
 *
 * Performance Analysis: Assume that [lhs] has size M and [rhs] has size N.
 * - Time: O(M * N)
 * - Space: O(1)
