     * Returns a new [Environment] that contains the [record] and encloses the current [Environment]. This is used to:
     * 1. Pass on a [Record] from a Rel to a Rex. Consider `SELECT a + 1 FROM t`. The PROJECT would likely grab the input
     * record from the SCAN, [push] it into the current environment, and pass it to the Expr representing `a + 1`.
     * 2. Create a nested scope. Consider `SELECT 1 + (SELECT t1.a + t2.b FROM t2 LIMIT 1) FROM t1`. Since the inner
     * SELECT (ExprSubquery) is creating a "nested scope", it would invoke [push].
     *
     * Here are the general rules to follow:
     * 1. When evaluating Expressions from within a Relation, one should always use [push] to "push" onto the stack.
     * 2. When evaluating Relations from within an Expression, one should always use [push] to "push" onto the stack.
     * 3. When evaluating Expressions from within a Relation, there is no need to use [push].
     * 4. When evaluating Relations from within a Relation, one **might** want to use [push]. Consider the LATERAL JOIN, for instance.
