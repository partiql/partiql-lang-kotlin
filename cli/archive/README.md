Thank you for downloading PartiQL!

This archive contains 

1. Startup scripts to run PartiQL (command line and REPL) under the `bin` folder 
1. All necessary libraries to run PartiQL under the `lib` folder 
1. The PartiQL tutorial and accompanying data and queries under the `Tutorial` folder. 

We recommend that you read through the tutorial first. The tutorial
provides a walk-through on how to run the PartiQL REPL and provides
examples of data, queries and use cases on some of PartiQL's unique
features to get you started.

We are always happy to [hear from your](https://github.com/partiql/partiql-lang-kotlin/issues)
and [collaborate with
you](https://github.com/partiql/partiql-lang-kotlin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
on evolving and improving PartiQL, and as always have fun along the way.

Best, 

The Ion Team
