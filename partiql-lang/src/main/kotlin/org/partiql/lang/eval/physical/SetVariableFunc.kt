/**
 * Sets the value of a variable which is stored in an [EvaluatorState].
 *
 * To obtain an instance of [SetVariableFunc] that sets a specific variable, see [toSetVariableFunc]. This is because
 * [EvaluatorState.registers] contains the current value of all variables in an SFW query.  As such, allowing direct
 * access to the registers is very risky--for example, if the wrong register is set the query will have the incorrect
 * result or trigger an evaluation-time exception.
 *
 * To mitigate this risk, [EvaluatorState.registers] is marked to `internal` to avoid exposing it publicly and
 * [SetVariableFunc] is provided to allow custom operator implementation to assign values to only specific variables
 * when needed.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * - [EvaluatorState] - The object containing the current state of the evaluator and current values of the variables.
 * - [ExprValue] - The value to set.

 * clobbered by a physical operator implementation which was not supplied by this library.
