/**
 * Represents the execution data of a PartiQL Statement as it relates to Code Coverage. This structure specifically
 * represents the aggregation of data of a particular statement. For example, a PartiQL Statement containing a single
 * boolean expression would be represented with a [CoverageStructure] containing two branches. However, upon execution
 * of the [Expression], this structure ([CoverageData]) will be populated with information related to which branches
 * were taken and their frequency. If the execution of a compiler query results in only a single branch being taken, this
 * class shall reflect that.
 *
 * NOTE: It's important to note that many implementations of [ExprValue] are **lazy**. Therefore, in order to retrieve
 * accurate [CoverageData], one must access each individual [ExprValue] of the [PartiQLResult] before accessing the
 * [CoverageData].
 *
 * @param branchCount represents the branch name (String) and the corresponding number of times it was executed.
 * @param branchConditionCount represents the branch-condition name (String) and the corresponding number of times it was executed.
