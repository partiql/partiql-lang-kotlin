= PartiQL Test Input Queries
:toc:

This package contains many input queries to be used in various parts of testing â€” parsing, planning, transpiling, evaluation.

== Structure

Query inputs are grouped by some general category which makes up a "test group". There are many opportunities to add more structure, but the premise
is to simply have a list of input queries, each of which has a unique identifier which is the group name along with a
special pragma comment (ex: `--#[my-test-name]`) above the statement. File names don't matter, only a suite directory
name is used. All statements within a group a treated as one big list regardless of file structure. You may choose
to group multiple short statements in one file, or split each query into its own file.

NOTE: I have not modified the generated TPC-DS schemas so everything is NULLABLE which isn't always the case. See
https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-ds_v2.6.0.pdf


== Schemas

Catalog and schema definition subject to change once PartiQL Value Schema is actually defined. The current version
is an iteration of John's initial work on the local plugin and Avro IDL. I'm finding it verbose which can make things
harder to read. Then again this is a plugin used for testing, so the input schema doesn't matter that much so long as
we can easily parse it.
