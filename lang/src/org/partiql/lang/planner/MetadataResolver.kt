     * which indicates if query author included double quotes (") which mean the lookup should be case-sensitive.

     * Implementations of this function must return:
     *
     * - [ResolutionResult.GlobalVariable] if [bindingName] matches a global variable (typically a database table).

     * should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive.  @see [BindingName.bindingCase].  In the event that more than one
     * variable matches a case-insensitive [BindingName], the implementation must still select one of them
     * without providing an error. (This is consistent with Postres's behavior in this scenario.)
