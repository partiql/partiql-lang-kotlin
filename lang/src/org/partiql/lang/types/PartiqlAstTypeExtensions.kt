    // PartiqlAst.Type to PartiqlPhysical.Type. The easiest way to do that without using a visitor transform
    // (which is overkill and comes with some downsides for something this simple), is to transform to and from
    // s-expressions again.  This will work without difficulty as long as PartiqlAst.Type remains unchanged in all
    // permuted domains between PartiqlAst and PartiqlPhysical.

    // This is really just a temporary measure, however, which must exist for as long as the type inferencer works only
    // on PartiqlAst.  When it has been migrated to use PartiqlPhysical instead, there should no longer be a reason
    // to keep this function around.
