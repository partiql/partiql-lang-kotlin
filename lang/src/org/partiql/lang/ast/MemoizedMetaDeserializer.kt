/**
 * Provides a common way to "deserialize" a memoized meta instance.
 *
 * "Memoized" metas are the same for every time they are used. This could be a "flag meta" (which has no properties
 * and the existence of the meta on a node is used to indicate a boolean condition) or meta of any time whos properties
 * do not vary from instance to instance.
 *
 * [MemoizedMetaDeserializer] is not appropriate for use with metas that have properties which can vary from
 * instance to instance or cannot otherwise be memoized.  Those need their own implementation of [MetaDeserializer].
