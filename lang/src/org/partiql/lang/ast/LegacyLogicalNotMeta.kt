package org.partiql.lang.ast

/**
 * The old AST has nodes: `not_like`, `not_between` and `is_not` which are respectively paired with its
 * `like`, `between`, and `is` nodes.
 *
 * The new AST lacks the `not` version of these, instead wrapping the non-`not` versions of these notes in a `not`
 * n-ary expression to achieve the same semantics.
 *
 * For example:
 *  - Legacy:  (not_like <expr>)
 *  - New AST (will be something like):
 *              (nary
 *                  (op not)
 *                  (args (nary like <expr>))
 *                  (metas ((name LegacyLogicalNotMeta))))
 *
 * [LegacyLogicalNotMeta] is added to `(nary (op not) ...` node so that the [ToLegacyAstPass] knows to emit the
 * `not_like`, `not_between` or `is_not` s-expression nodes.
