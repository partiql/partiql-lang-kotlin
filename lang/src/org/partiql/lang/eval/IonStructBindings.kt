/**
 * Custom implementation of [Bindings] that lazily computes case sensitive or insensitive hash tables which
 * will speed up the lookup of bindings within structs.
 *
 * The key difference in behavior between this and other [Bindings] implementations is that it
 * can throw an ambiguous binding [EvaluationException] even for case-sensitive lookups as it is
 * entirely possible that fields with identical names can appear within [IonStruct]s.
 *
 * Important: this class is critical to performance for many queries.  Change with caution.
