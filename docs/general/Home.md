# Overview

This project is an implementation of the [PartiQL Specification](https://partiql.org/assets/PartiQL-Specification.pdf).
PartiQL is based on SQL-92 and has added support for working with schemaless hierarchical data. PartiQLâ€™s extensions to
SQL are easy to understand, treat nested data as first class citizens and compose seamlessly with each other and SQL.

You can find more information on [our website](https://partiql.org).
