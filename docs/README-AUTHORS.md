* `docs/user`. Typing `make` builds the user guide
* `docs/dev`. Typing `make` builds the dev guide

# Authoring Documentation 

All documentation is written in [`pandoc`
markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) stored in
files whose extension is `.md`.

Each guide (user and dev) contain a file `outline.txt` that lists the
`.md` files that will be concatenated together (in the order that they
appear in `outline.txt`) to create the complete guide. `pandoc` is then used 
to translated the complete guide into the output formats (html, pdf, etc).
