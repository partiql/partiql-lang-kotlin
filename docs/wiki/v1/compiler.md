# PartiQL Compiler Guide

This document is a guide to using the PartiQL compiler.

## Overview

The compiler is responsible for converting logical plans (an _operator_ tree)
to physical plans (an _expr_ tree) by applying _strategies_. A _strategy_ is a class
that has a _pattern_ and an _apply_ method. The pattern determines when to
invoke the _apply_ method which converts the matched operators (logical) to expressions (physical).

## Pattern Matching

A pattern is a tree composed of nodes with one of the types,

```
TYPE:   T â€“ match if class T, check children.
ANY:    ? - match any node, check children.
ALL:    * - match all nodes in the subtree.
```

For backwards compatibility, a pattern will ignore unmatched children.
If this is not the desired behavior, a pattern can be marked as "strict"
which will match children exactly and error on extraneous children.

### Example

Let's combine a limit and offset into a single relational expression; the logical tree looks like this.

```
RelLimit         Pattern.match(..)
   \
    RelOffset       Pattern.match(..)
       \
        *              match any offset child
```

We use the builders to create a pattern, intentionally omitting `RelOffset` children.

```
Pattern.match(RelLimit::class)
       .child(Pattern.match(RelOffset::class))
       .build()
```

The compiler will look for this pattern in the operator tree, and produce a match like so,

```
Match {
   matched: [ RelLimit, RelOffset ],
   children: [ Expr ],
}
```

Where `Expr` is the compiled child to `RelOffset`.
