# PartiQL Window Function Doc

Window function:
This PartiQL implementation currently supports SQL’s window functions with in-line window specification, i.e. `f(x) OVER ([window-specification])`.  Note that frame clause is not currently supported (but will be in the future).

Window functions are special functions that compute aggregated values over a window of input binding tuples. Like a general function, a window function returns a value for every binding tuple in the binding collection. At a very high level, window functions behave as if they can access binding tuples other than the current one in a binding collection.

A window function call is identified by an OVER clause, which can optionally contain three sub-clauses `PARTITION BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `FRAME` (`FRAME` is not supported at the moment). 

The `PARTITION BY` sub-clause acts similar to `GROUP BY`, which splits the input data into partitions based on partition keys. For example, a set of cars may be partitioned by makers, a set of stocks may be partitioned by ticker. The window function can only access the binding tuples within the same partition, and if there is no `PARTITION BY`, all the binding tuples are within one partition. 

The `ORDER BY` sub-clause uses the same logic as a normal `ORDER BY` clause, but it determine only the ordering of binding tuples within each partition, and may not necessarily has effects on the final order of the results.

## Supported Window Functions:
- [Lag](#lag-function)
- [Lead](#lead-function)

### Lag Function:
Syntax:
```
LAG(expr [, offset [, default]]) 
    OVER ([window-partition-clause] window-order-by-clause) 
```

Purpose:
Returns the value from a binding tuple at a given offset *prior to* the current binding tuple position in the window partition.

Arguments:
* expr: 
  * The expression to be evaluated based on specific offset. `expr` can be an expression of any type but another window function expression.
  * For example, `expr` can be in form of literal, attribute name, path expression, or subquery, but `LAG(LAG(...) OVER ... ) OVER ...)` is not allowed. 
* offset: 
  * The number of “rows” back from the current binding tuple from which the `expr` should be evaluated upon. If `offset` is not specified, the default value is 1. `offset` can be an expression of any type but window function. If `offset` is not a constant value, it should be evaluated upon the current binding tuple instead of the offset binding tuple. `offset` should be evaluated to a non-negative integer.
* default: 
  * The value to return when `offset` is out of the scope of the partition. If  `default` is not specified, the default value is `NULL`.

Window specification:

* PARTITION BY sub-clause is optional.
* ORDER BY sub-clause has to be specified in order to use `LAG` function.

Example:

Consider our dataset to be:

```
stock_price : <<
    { date: 2022-09-30, ticker: AMZN, price: 113.00}
    { date: 2022-10-03, ticker: AMZN, price: 115.88}
    { date: 2022-10-04, ticker: AMZN, price: 121.09}
    { date: 2022-09-30, ticker: GOOG, price: 96.15}
    { date: 2022-10-03, ticker: GOOG, price: 99.30}
    { date: 2022-10-04, ticker: GOOG, price: 101.04}
    >>
```

1. For each ticker, find the price for each day and the previous day

Consider how we would achieve this query without `LAG` function:
```
SELECT 
    all_record."date",
    all_record.ticker,
    all_record.price AS curr_price, 
    (CASE WHEN non_null_prev.prev_price IS MISSING THEN NULL 
          ELSE non_null_prev.prev_price END) AS prev_price 
FROM stock_price AS all_record 
    LEFT JOIN 
        (SELECT curr."date", 
                curr.ticker, 
                curr.price, 
                prev.price AS prev_price 
         FROM stock_price AS curr 
             JOIN stock_price AS prev 
             ON curr.ticker = prev.ticker 
                AND prev."date" < curr."date" 
                AND NOT EXISTS( 
                    SELECT * FROM stock_price AS inter 
                        WHERE inter.ticker = curr.ticker
                        AND inter."date" < curr."date" 
                        AND inter."date" > prev."date")
         ) AS non_null_prev 
         ON all_record."date" = non_null_prev."date" 
         AND all_record.ticker = non_null_prev.ticker
```

With lag function, the query can be simplified as
```
SELECT sp.date as date, 
       sp.ticker as ticker, 
       sp.price as current_price,
       lag(sp.price) OVER (PARTITION BY sp.ticker ORDER BY sp.date) as previous_price
    FROM stock_price as sp
```

The result is
```
<< 
   { date: 2022-09-30, ticker: AMZN, current_price: 113.00, previous_price: NULL}
   { date: 2022-10-03, ticker: AMZN, current_price: 115.88, previous_price: 113.00}
   { date: 2022-10-04, ticker: AMZN, current_price: 121.09, previous_price: 115.88}
   { date: 2022-09-30, ticker: GOOG, current_price: 96.15, previous_price: NULL}
   { date: 2022-10-03, ticker: GOOG, current_price: 99.30, previous_price: 96.15}
   { date: 2022-10-04, ticker: GOOG, current_price: 101.04, previous_price: 99.30}
>>     
```

2. Use of aggregate function:
```
SELECT 
    month as current_month, 
    ticker as ticker, 
    avg(price) as current_month_average,
    lag(avg(price)) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY month) as previous_month_avg
    FROM stock_price as sp 
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sp.date) as month, sp.ticker as ticker GROUP AS g
```

```
<< 
   { current_month: 9, ticker: AMZN, current_month_average: 113.00, previous_month_avg: NULL}
   { current_month: 10, ticker: AMZN, current_month_average: 118.49, previous_month_avg: 113.00}
   { current_month: 9, ticker: GOOG, current_month_average: 96.15, previous_month_avg: NULL}
   { current_month: 10, ticker: GOOG, current_month_average: 100.17, previous_month_avg: 96.15}
>> 
```

3. Outer Order By:
```
SELECT sp."date" as "date",
       sp.ticker as ticker,
       sp.price as current_price,
       lag(sp.price) OVER (PARTITION BY sp.ticker ORDER BY sp."date") as previous_price
FROM stock_price as sp
ORDER BY sp."date" DESC
```

```
[
  { 'date': `2022-10-04`, 'ticker': 'AMZN', 'current_price': 121.09, 'previous_price': 115.88},
  { 'date': `2022-10-04`, 'ticker': 'GOOG', 'current_price': 101.04, 'previous_price': 99.30},
  { 'date': `2022-10-03`, 'ticker': 'AMZN', 'current_price': 115.88, 'previous_price': 113.00},
  { 'date': `2022-10-03`, 'ticker': 'GOOG', 'current_price': 99.30, 'previous_price': 96.15},
  { 'date': `2022-09-30`, 'ticker': 'AMZN', 'current_price': 113.00, 'previous_price': NULL},
  { 'date': `2022-09-30`, 'ticker': 'GOOG', 'current_price': 96.15, 'previous_price': NULL}
]
```

Notice here the output is a list, whereas the results in previous query return a bag. This is because the window order by only logically order the partition.

4. Missing Binding:

It is worth to distinguish the `out of window partition` vs `no such binding.`

Consider:
```
SELECT 
       lag(sp.a, 1, 'Out Of Partition') 
            OVER (PARTITION BY sp.ticker ORDER BY sp."date") as previous_a
FROM stock_price as sp
ORDER BY sp."date" DESC
```

The result is :
```
<<
  { 'previous_a': 'Out of Partition' },
  {},
  {}
  { 'previous_a': 'Out of Partition' }, 
  {}
  {}
>>
```

The first row returns `{ 'previous_a': 'Out of Partition' }` because current row is the first row in partition, and `lag(sp.a)` tries to access the row before, which is out of the window partition. Therefore it returns the default value.
The second row returns an empty struct `{}` , this is because the current row is now the second row , and `lag(sp.a)` essentially evaluates `sp.a` over the binding tuple `{ date: 2022-09-30, ticker: AMZN, price: 113.00}`. Since there is no binding name `a` in the binding tuple, the query returns `missing`.

### Lead Function:
Syntax:
```
LEAD(expr [, offset [, default]]) 
    OVER ([window-partition-clause] window-order-by-clause) 
```

Purpose:
Returns the value from a binding tuple at a given offset *after* the current binding tuple position in the window partition.

Note that `Lag` and `Lead` perform similar operation and have similar semantics, except for the fact that `Lag` looks for `x` rows prior to the current row and `Lead` looks for `x` rows after.

Arguments:
* expr:
    * The expression to be evaluated based on specific offset. `expr` can be an expression of any type but another window function expression.
* offset:
    * The number of “rows” after the current binding tuple from which the `expr` should be evaluated upon. If `offset` is not specified, the default value is 1. `offset` can be an expression of any type but window function. If `offset` is not a constant value, it should be evaluated upon the current binding tuple instead of the offset binding tuple. `offset` should be evaluated to a non-negative integer.
* default:
    * The value to return when `offset` is out of the scope of the partition. If  `default` is not specified, the default value is `NULL`.

Window specification:

* PARTITION BY sub-clause is optional.
* ORDER BY sub-clause has to be specified in order to use `LEAD` function.

Example:

Consider our dataset is :

```
stock_price : <<
    { date: 2022-09-30, ticker: AMZN, price: 113.00}
    { date: 2022-10-03, ticker: AMZN, price: 115.88}
    { date: 2022-10-04, ticker: AMZN, price: 121.09}
    { date: 2022-09-30, ticker: GOOG, price: 96.15}
    { date: 2022-10-03, ticker: GOOG, price: 99.30}
    { date: 2022-10-04, ticker: GOOG, price: 101.04}
    >>
```

1. For each ticker, find the price for each day and the following day
```
SELECT sp.date as date, 
       sp.ticker as ticker, 
       sp.price as current_price,
       lead(sp.price) OVER (PARTITION BY sp.ticker ORDER BY sp.date) as next_price
    FROM stock_price as sp
```

The result is
```
<< 
   { date: 2022-09-30, ticker: AMZN, current_price: 113.00, next_price: 115.88}
   { date: 2022-10-03, ticker: AMZN, current_price: 115.88, next_price: 121.09}
   { date: 2022-10-04, ticker: AMZN, current_price: 121.09, next_price: NULL}
   { date: 2022-09-30, ticker: GOOG, current_price: 96.15, next_price: 99.30}
   { date: 2022-10-03, ticker: GOOG, current_price: 99.30, next_price: 101.04}
   { date: 2022-10-04, ticker: GOOG, current_price: 101.04, next_price: NULL}
>>     
```
