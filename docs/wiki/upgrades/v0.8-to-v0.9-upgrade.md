# v0.9.x

## New features
* Adds simple auto-completion to the CLI.
* Adds the IsListParenthesizedMeta meta to aid in differentiating between parenthesized and non*parenthesized lists
* Adds support for HAVING clause in planner
* Adds support for collection aggregation functions in the EvaluatingCompiler and experimental planner
* Adds support for the syntactic sugar of using aggregations functions in place of their collection aggregation function
  counterparts (in the experimental planner)
* Experimental implementation for window function `Lag` and `Lead`.
* Adds support for EXPLAIN
* Adds continuous performance benchmarking to the CI for existing JMH benchmarks
    * Benchmark results can be seen on the project's GitHub Pages site
* Adds the `pipeline` flag to the CLI to provide experimental usage of the PartiQLCompilerPipeline
* Added `ExprValue.toIonValue(ion: IonSystem)` in kotlin, and `ExprValueKt.toIonValue(value: ExprValue, ion: IonSystem)` in Java to transform one `ExprValue` to a corresponding `IonValue`.

## Deprecated items
* Marks the GroupKeyReferencesVisitorTransform as deprecated. There is no functionally equivalent class.
* Marks `ionValue` property in `ExprValue` interface as deprecated. The functional equivalent method is `ExprValue.toIonValue(ion: IonSystem)` in kotlin, and `ExprValueKt.toIonValue(value: ExprValue, ion: IonSystem)` in Java.
* Marks `Lexer`, `Token`, `TokenType`, `SourcePosition`, and `SourceSpan` as deprecated. These will be removed without
  any replacement.
* Marks approximately 60 `ErrorCode`'s as deprecated. These will be removed without any replacement.
* Marks `Property.TOKEN_TYPE` as deprecated. Please use `Property.TOKEN_DESCRIPTION`.

## Misc/bug fixes
* Fixes the ThreadInterruptedTests by modifying the time to interrupt parses. Also adds better exception exposure to
  facilitate debugging.
