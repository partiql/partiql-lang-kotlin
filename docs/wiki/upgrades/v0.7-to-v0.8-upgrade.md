# v0.8.x

## Breaking Changes

### Breaking Behavioral Changes
1. Parsing of ORDER BY clauses will no longer populate the AST with defaults for the 'sort specification'
   (i.e., ASC or DESC) or 'nulls specification' (i.e., NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST) when they are not provided in 
   the query text. Defaulting of sort order is moved to the evaluator.

### Breaking API Changes
1. Replaced union, intersect, except IR nodes with common bag_op IR nodes.
2. Renamed PassResult to PlannerPassResult for clarity. (This is part of the experimental query planner API.)
3. Removed [ExprValueType.typeNames] as needed by the future work of legacy parser removal and OTS.
