# Introduction 

PartiQL provides SQL-compatible unified query access across multiple
data stores containing structured, semi-structured and nested data that
is supported by SQL.  PartiQL separates the syntax and semantics of a
query from the underlying data source and/or data format of the data.
It enables users to interact with data with[^schema] or without
regular schema.

[^schema]: The implementation currently only supports data without
schema. Schema support is forthcoming.

This tutorial aims to teach SQL users the PartiQL extensions to SQL. The
tutorial is primarily driven by "how to" examples.

For the reader who is interested in the full detail and formal
specification of PartiQL, we recommend the 2-tiered PartiQL formal
specification: The formal specification first describes the *PartiQL
core*, which is a short and concise functional programming language.
Then the specification layers SQL compatibility through syntactic sugar
that shows how SQL features can be translated to semantically equivalent
core PartiQL expressions. These translations presented as syntactic sugar
enable SQL compatibility.



# PartiQL Queries are SQL compatible 

PartiQL is backwards compatible with SQL-92[^SQL92-Spec]. We will see what
compatibility means when it is used to query data found in data formats
and data stores that are not SQL.

[^SQL92-Spec]:[SQL-92](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt)

For starters, given the table `hr.employees`

  Id             name          title
  -------------- ------------- ----------------
  3              Bob Smith     null
  4              Susan Smith   Dev Mgr
  6              Jane Smith    Software Eng 2


the following SQL query 

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q1.sql}
```

is also a valid PartiQL query.  As we know from SQL, when this query
operates on the table `hr.employees` it will return the result

  Id   employeeName   title
  ---- -------------- ---------
  4    Susan Smith    Dev Mgr

## PartiQL data model: Abstraction of many underlying data storage formats

PartiQL implementations operate not just on SQL tables but also on data
that may have nesting, union types, different attributes across
different tuples and many other features that we often find in today's
nested and/or semi-structured formats, like JSON, Parquet, etc.

To capture this generality, PartiQL is based on a logical type system:
the *PartiQL data model*. Each PartiQL implementation maps data formats,
like JSON, Parquet etc., into a PartiQL data set that follows the PartiQL
data model. PartiQL queries work on the PartiQL data set abstraction.

For example, the table `hr.employees` is denoted in the PartiQL data
model as this dataset

```{include=tutorial/code/q1.env}
```
Notice that the `employees` is nested within `hr`.  
The delimiters `<<` ... `>>` denote that the data
is an *unordered collection* (also known as *bag*), as is the case
with SQL's tables. That is, there is no order between the three tuples.
Single line comments start with `--` and end at the end of the line. 

A very different kind of data source may lead to the same PartiQL
dataset. For example, a set of JSON files that contain the following
JSON objects 

```
{ 
    "hr" : { 
        "employees": [
            { "id": 3, "name": "Bob Smith",   "title": null },
            { "id": 4, "name": "Susan Smith", "title": "Dev Mgr" },
            { "id": 6, "name": "Jane Smith",  "title": "Software Eng 2"}
        ]
    }
}

```

will likely[^JSONdata] be abstracted by a PartiQL-supporting
implementation into the identical PartiQL abstraction with the
`hr.employees` table.

[^JSONdata]: The JSON value attached to `employee` is an *ordered*
list. PartiQL implementations may provide their own mappings from popular
data formats, e.g., CSV, TSV, JSON, Ion etc., to the PartiQL data model and/or allow clients
to implements their own mappings.

**Remark:** You will keep noticing the similarity of the PartiQL
notation with the JSON notation. Notice also the subtle differences: In
the interest of SQL compatibility, a PartiQL literal is quoted, while
JSON literals are double-quoted.

**Remark:** You may conceptually think that a deserializer inputs JSON
and outputs the PartiQL data set. But do not assume that the query
processing of a PartiQL implementation will have to actually parse and
abstract into PartiQL each and every bit of the underlying data storage.
For example, AWS services like Redshift Spectrum and QLDB do much
smarter things in order to evaluate your PartiQL queries efficiently.

Back to our PartiQL query


```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q1.sql}
```

evaluates in PartiQL and returns 

```{include=tutorial/code/q1.output} 
```

the result remains the same, no matter whether the `hr.employees` were
the SQL table or the JSON file. All that is needed is that a catalog
associates the *name* `hr.employees` with the PartiQL abstraction of
the JSON data.

In the same spirit, the same PartiQL abstraction may come from a CVS
file or a Parquet file, a format that has gained big traction, thanks to
the efficient way in which it stores data. Again, the same query makes
perfect sense, regardless of what exactly was the storage format behind
`hr.employees`.

### Learn more

-   **PartiQL data sets look very much like JSON.**

    What are the differences? Indeed, PartiQL adopts the tuple/object and array
    notation of JSON. However, the PartiQL string literals are denoted
    by single quotes. Importantly, the scalar types of PartiQL are the
    ones of SQL and not just strings, numbers and booleans, as in JSON.

-   **Do implementations need to have a catalog?**

    If queries refer to
    names, a catalog logically validates whether the name exists or not.
    However, we will also see PartiQL queries that refer to no names.

# Querying Nested Data


SQL-92 only has tables that have tuples that contain scalar values. A key
feature of many modern formats is nested data. That is, attributes whose
values may be themselves tables (i.e., collections of tuples), or may be
arrays of scalars, or arrays of arrays and many other combinations. We next
present PartiQL's features (SQL extensions) that allow us to work with nested data.

We also include sections titled "Use Case". Such "Use Case" sections do not
introduce additional features. They merely show how to combine the
few novel PartiQL features with standard SQL features in order to
solve a large number of problems.

## Nested Collections

Let's now add the nested attribute `projects` into the data set.

```{include=tutorial/code/q2.env}
```

Notice that the value of `'projects'` is an array. Arrays are denoted by
`[ ... ]` with array elements separated by `,`. In our example the array
happens to be an array of tuples. We will see that arrays may be arrays
of anything, not just arrays of tuples.

### Unnesting a Nested Collection

The query finds the names of employees who work on projects that contain
the string `'security'` and outputs them along with the name of the
`'security'` project. Notice that the query has just one extension
over standard SQL -- the `e.projects AS p` part.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q2.sql}
```

The output of our query is

```{include=tutorial/code/q2.output}
```

The extension over SQL is the `FROM` clause item `e.projects AS p`.
Standard SQL would attempt to find a schema named `e` with a table
`projects` and since in our example there isn't an `e.projects`
table, the query would fail. In contrast, PartiQL will dereference
`e.projects` to the attribute `projects` of `e`.

Once we allow this extension, the semantics are alike SQL's. The alias
(also called *variable* in PartiQL) `e` gets bound to each employee, in
turn. For each employee, the variable `p` gets bound to each
project of the employee, in turn. Thus the query's meaning, alike SQL,
is

| foreach employee tuple `e` from `hr.employeesNest`
|     foreach project tuple `p` from `e.projects`
|         if `p.name LIKE '%security%'`
|         output `e.name AS employeeName, p.name AS projectName`

Notice that our query involved variables that were ranging over nested
collections (`p` in the example), along with variables that were
ranging over tables (`e` in the example), as standard SQL aliases do.
All variables, no matter what they range over, can be used wherever in
the `FROM`, `WHERE`, `SELECT` clauses as we will see in the examples that follow.

### Learn more

-   **Can I only unnest arrays of tuples?**

    No, anything can be unnested.
    For example, arrays of scalars, etc.

-   **Does `e.projects AS p` have to appear in the same `FROM` clause
    that defines `e`?** 
    
    No. For example, see below the use cases that
    involve subqueries. There, the `e` and `p` are defined in
    separate `FROM` clauses.

-   **How could I force `e.projects` to refer to the nested attribute
    `projects` even if there were a schema named `e` with a table
    `projects`?** 
   
     Use the syntax `@e.projects`. Recall, in the
    absence of the `@`, in the interest of SQL compatibility, PartiQL
    will first attempt to dereference the `e.projects` against the
    catalog.

-   **SQL allows me to avoid writing an explicit alias `e` when I write,
    say, `e.name`. Can I avoid writing the `e` in PartiQL as well?**
   
    SQL allows us to avoid writing aliases (variables) when the schema of
    the tables allows correct dereferencing. PartiQL does the same.
    However, recall, a schema is not necessary for a PartiQL data set.
    Indeed, our example has not assumed a schema. Then , in the absence
    of a schema, you cannot omit the aliases (variables). For example,
    if you write just `name` and there is no schema, PartiQL cannot
    tell whether you mean employee name or project name. Thus you need
    to explicitly write the alias (variable).

    There is one exception to this rule: If your query has a single item
    in its `FROM` clause, you can omit the alias (variable). Eg, you
    can write

    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM hr.employeesNest
    ```

    In this case it is apparent that `name` may only be an employee
    name and thus PartiQL allows you to not provide an alias (variable).

    Nevertheless, for clarity we recommend that you always use aliases
    (variables) and this is what this tutorial does.

-   **If there is a schema, can I avoid writing the alias `p`?**

    No. The `p` has to be written in order to denote the iteration over the
    projects.

### Unnesting Nested Collections Using `JOIN`

In this section, we simply present an alternate way to express and think
about unnesting collections. 

One may think that the `FROM` clause of the
example executes, in a sense, a `JOIN` between employees and projects.
Except that unlike a conventional SQL join that would require an **`ON`
condition**, the employees-projects join condition is implicit in the
nesting of the projects data into the employee data. If it helps you to
think in terms of `JOIN`, you may replace the comma with `JOIN`.
That is, the following two queries are equivalent.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ```sql                            | ```sql                            | 
| SELECT e.name AS employeeName,    | SELECT e.name AS employeeName,    |
|        p.name AS projectName      |        p.name AS projectName      |
| FROM hr.employeesNest AS e,       | FROM hr.employeesNest AS e JOIN   |
|      e.projects AS p              |     e.projects AS p               |
| WHERE p.name LIKE '%security%'    | WHERE p.name LIKE '%security%'    |
| ```                               | ```                               | 
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+


### Unnesting data with LEFT JOIN always preserves parent information


Assume that we want to write a query that returns as a bag of
tuples the entire employee and project information from
`hr.employeesNest`. The query result we want is this bag of tuples
with attributes `id`, `employeeName`, `title` and `projectName`:

```{include=tutorial/code/q3.output}
```

Notice that there is a `'Susan Smith'` tuple in the result, despite the
fact that Susan has no project. Susan's `projectName` is `null`.
We can obtain this result by combining employees and projects using the
`LEFT JOIN` operator, as follows:

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q3.sql}
```

The semantics of this query can be thought of as

| foreach employee tuple `e` from `hr.employeesNest`
|     if the `e.projects` is an empty collection then *// this part is special about LEFT JOINs*
|         output `e.id AS id`, `e.name AS employeeName`, `e.title AS title`
|         and output a `null AS projectName`
|     else *// the following part is identical to plain (inner) JOINs*
|         foreach project tuple `p` from `e.projects`
|             output `e.id AS id`, `e.name AS employeeName`, `e.title AS title`
|             and output a `null AS projectName`

### Use Case: Checking whether a nested collection satisfies a condition 

The following use cases employ the unnesting features, which we have
already discussed, in new use cases. A lesson that emerges is that we
can use variables (SQL aliases) that range over nested data as if they were
standard SQL aliases. This realization gives us the power to solve
a great number of use cases just be combining the unnesting features
with features we already know from standard SQL.

In our first use case we want a query that returns the names of the
employees that are involved in a project that contains the word
`'security`. The solution employs SQL's "`EXISTS` (subquery)"
feature, along with unnesting:

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employeeName
FROM hr.employeesNest AS e
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *
               FROM e.projects AS p
               WHERE p.name LIKE '%security%')
```

returns 

```
<<
  {
    'employeeName': 'Bob Smith'
  },
  {
    'employeeName': 'Jane Smith'
  }
>>
--- 
OK! (14 ms)

```


In the second use case we want a query that outputs the names of the
employees that have more than one security projects and 
we are aware of a key for employees (e.g., an attribute
that is guaranteed to have a unique value for each employee).
We can find the requested employees by utilizing a combination of
`GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. [^subquerybug] In our example, let's assume that the
`id` attribute is a primary key for the employees. Then we could find
the employees with more than one security project with this query:

[^subquerybug]: We could also have used the `>` operator with the subquery's result, but a current [issue](https://github.com/partiql/partiql-lang-kotlin/issues/81) with the implementation currently prevents us from doing so. 

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employeeName
FROM hr.employeesNest e, 
     e.projects AS p
WHERE p.name LIKE '%security%'
GROUP BY e.id, e.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

which returns 

```
<<
  {
    'employeeName': 'Bob Smith'
  }
>>
--- 
OK! (28 ms)

```

### Use Case: Subqueries that aggregate over nested collections


Next, let's find how many querying projects (that is, projects whose
name contains the word 'querying') each employee has.[^subquerybug]

Making the same asssumption as before, that `id` is a key for employees, we can solve 
the problem with the query 

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employeeName, 
       COUNT(p.name) AS queryProjectsNum
FROM hr.employeesNest e LEFT JOIN e.projects AS p ON p.name LIKE '%querying%'
GROUP BY e.id, e.name
```

that returns 

```
<<
  {
    'employeeName': 'Bob Smith',
    'queryProjectsNum': 1
  },
  {
    'employeeName': 'Susan Smith',
    'queryProjectsNum': 0
  },
  {
    'employeeName': 'Jane Smith',
    'queryProjectsNum': 0
  }
>>
--- 
OK! (22 ms)
```

Notice, this query's result includes Susan Smith and Jane Smith, who have no
querying projects.


## Nested Tuple Values and Multi-Step Paths

A value may also be a tuple -- also called object and struct in many
models and formats. For example, the project value in the following
tuples is always a tuple with project name and project org.

```{include=tutorial/code/q5.env}
```

PartiQL's multistep paths enable navigating within tuples. For example,
the following query finds AWS projects and outputs the project name and
employee name.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q5.sql}
```
The result is

```{include=tutorial/code/q5.output}
```
## Unnesting Arbitrary Forms of Nested Collections

The previous examples have shown nested attributes that were arrays of
tuples. It need not be the case that the nested attributes are
collections of tuples. They may just as well be arrays of scalars,
arrays of arrays, and more. In general any combination of data that one
can create by composing scalars, tuples and arrays. You need not learn a
different set of query language features for each case. The unnesting
features, which we have already seen, are sufficient.

### Use Case: Unnesting Arrays of Scalars

The list of projects associated with each employee in
`hr.employeesNest` could have been simply a list of project name
strings. Replacing the nested tuples with plain strings gives us

```{include=tutorial/code/q6.env}
```

Let us repeat the previous use cases on the revised employee data.

The following query finds the names of employees who work on projects
that contain the string `'security'` and outputs them along with the name
of the 'security' project.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q6.sql}
```
The preceding query returns 

```{include=tutorial/code/q6.output}
```

The variable `p` ranges (again) over the content of `e.projects`. In
this case, since `e.projects` has strings (as opposed to tuples), the
variable `p` binds each time to a project name string. Thus, this
query can be thought of as executing the following snippet.

| foreach employee tuple `e` from `hr.employeesNestScalars`
|     foreach project `p` from `e.projects`
|         if the string `p` matches `'%security%'`
|         output `e.name AS employeeName` and the string `p AS projectName`

### Use Case: Unnesting Arrays of Arrays

Arrays may also contain arrays, directly, without intervening tuples, as
in the `matrices` data set.

```{include=tutorial/code/q7.env}
```

The following query finds every even number and outputs the even number
and the `id` of the tuple where it was found.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q7.sql}
```

The preceding query returns 

```{include=tutorial/code/q7.output}
```

Informally the query's evaluation can be thought of as 

| foreach tuple `t` from `matrices`
|     foreach array `y` from `t.matrix`
|         foreach number `x` from `y`
|             if `x` is even then
|                 output `t.id AS id` and `x AS even`


# Literals

Literals of the PartiQL query language correspond to the types in
the PartiQL data model:

-   scalars, including `null` which follow the SQL syntax when
    applicable. For example:

    -   `5`

    -   `'foo'`

-   tuples, denoted by  `{...}` with tuple elements separated by `,` (also known as structs and/or objects in
    many formats and other data models)

    -   `{ 'id' : 3, 'arr': [1, 2] }`

-   arrays, denoted by `[...]` with array elements separated by `,`

    -   `[ 1, 'foo' ]`

-   bags, denoted by `<< ... >>` with bag elements separated by a `,`

    -   `<< 1, 'foo'>>`

Notice that in the spirit of the PartiQL data model, literals compose
freely and any kind of literal may appear within any tuple, array and
bag literal, eg.,

```
{ 
    'id': 3, 
    'matrix': [ 
        [2, 4, 6],
        'NA'
    ]
}
```

# Querying Heterogeneous and Schemaless Data


Many formats do not require a schema that describes the data -- that is
*schemaless data*. In such cases it is possible to have various
"heterogeneities" in the data:

-   One tuple may have an attribute `x` while another tuple may not have
    this attribute

-   In one tuple of a collection an attribute `x` may be of type, e.g.,
    string, while in another tuple of the same collection the same
    attribute `x` may be of a different type -- e.g, array.

-   The elements of a collection (be it a bag or array) can be heterogeneous (not have
    the same type). For example, the first element may be a string, the
    second one may be an integer and the third one an array.

-   Generally, any composition is possible as we can bundle
    heterogeneous elements in arrays and bags.

Heterogeneities are not particular to schemaless. Schemas may allow for
heterogeneity in the types of the data. For example, one of the Hive
data types is the union type,[^HiveUnionType] which allows a value to belong to any one of a
list of types. For example, in the following schema the `projects` attribute may be
either a string or an array of strings

[^HiveUnionType]: [Hive Union Type](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-UnionTypesunionUnionTypes)

```sql
CREATE TABLE employeesMixed(
        id: INT,
        name: STRING,
        title: STRING,
        projects: UNIONTYPE<STRING, ARRAY<STRING>>
);
```

A collection of PartiQL tuples that follows this schema could be

```
{ 
    'hr': { 
        'employeesMixed1': <<
            { 
                'id': 3, 
                    'name': 'Bob Smith', 
                    'title': null, 
                    'projects': [ 
                        'AWS Redshift Spectrum querying',
                    'AWS Redshift security',
                    'AWS Aurora security'
                    ]
            },
            { 
                'id': 4, 
                'name': 'Susan Smith', 
                'title': 'Dev Mgr', 
                'projects': [] 
            },
            { 
                'id': 6, 
                'name': 'Jane Smith', 
                'title': 'Software Eng 2', 
                'projects': 'AWS Redshift security' 
            }
        >>
    }
}
```

Thus we see that data may have heterogeneities -- regardless of whether
they are described by a schema or not. PartiQL tackles heterogeneous
data, in ways that we will see in the next use cases and feature
presentations.

## Tuples with Missing Attributes

Let's go back to the `hr.employees` table (that is, bag of tuples).
Bob Smith has no title and, as is typical in SQL, the lack of title is
modeled with the `null` value.

```
{ 
    'hr': { 
        'employees': <<
            { 'id': 3, 'name': 'Bob Smith',   'title': null }
            { 'id': 4, 'name': 'Susan Smith', 'title': 'Dev Mgr' }
            { 'id': 6, 'name': 'Jane Smith',  'title': 'Software Eng 2'}
        >>
    }
}
```

Nowadays, many semi-structured formats allow users to represent
"missing" information in two ways. 

1. The first way is by use of `null`.
1. The second kind is the plain absence of the attribute from the
tuple. 

That is, we can represent the fact that Bob Smith has no title
by simply having no `title` attribute in the `'Bob Smith'` tuple:

```{include=tutorial/code/q8.env}
```
PartiQL does not argue about when to use `null`s and when to use
"missing". Myriads of datasets already use one of the two or both.
However, PartiQL enables queries to distinguish when they access a
`null` Vs when they access a missing attribute. PartiQL also enables
queries to create results that have both `null`s and missing attributes.
Indeed, it makes it very easy to propagate source data `null`s as query
result `null`s and source data missing attributes into result missing
attributes.

## Accessing and Processing Missing Attributes: The MISSING Value

Consider again this PartiQL query, which happens to also be an SQL
query.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q8.sql}
```

What will happen when the query goes over the Bob Smith tuple, which has
no `title`?

The first step to answering this question is understanding the result of
the path `e.title` when the alias (variable) `e` binds to the tuple
`{ 'id': 3, 'name': 'Bob Smith' }`. In more basic terms, what is the
result of the expression `{ 'id': 3, 'name': 'Bob Smith' }.path` ?
PartiQL says that it is the special value `MISSING`. `MISSING`
behaves very similar to `null`.


### Evaluating Functions and Conditions with MISSING

If a function (including infix functions like `=`) inputs a
`MISSING` the function's result is also `MISSING`. In the case of the example,
this means that the `WHERE` clause `e.title='Dev Mgr'` will evaluate
to `MISSING` when `e` binds to `{ 'id': 3, 'name': 'Bob Smith' }`
and, as usual in SQL, the `WHERE` clause fails when it does not
evaluate to `true`. Thus the output will be

```{include=tutorial/code/q8.output}
```

### Propagating MISSING in Result Tuples

What would happen if a missing attribute or, more generally, an
expression returning `MISSING` appears in the `SELECT`?

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q9.sql}
```

The query will output one tuple for each employee. When it outputs the
Bob Smith tuple, the `e.title` will evaluate to `MISSING` and then
the output tuple will not even have an `outputTitle` attribute.

```{include=tutorial/code/q9.output}
```

The same treatment of `MISSING` would happen if, say, we had this
query that converts titles to capital letters:

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q10.sql}
```

Again, the `e.title` will evaluate to `MISSING` for `'Bob Smith'`, the
`UPPER(e.title)` is then `UPPER(MISSING)` and also evaluates to `MISSING`.
Thus the result will be

```{include=tutorial/code/q10.output}
```

## Variables can range over Data with Different Types

A PartiQL variable (called *alias* in SQL) can bind to data of
different types during a query's evaluation. This is unlike SQL where
the variables always bind to tuples. It is even different from what
happened in [Use Case: Unnesting Arrays of Scalars](#use-case-unnesting-arrays-of-scalars) and
what happened in [Use Case: Unnesting Arrays of Arrays](#use-case-unnesting-arrays-of-arrays). 

In the first use case, the PartiQL variable `p`
happened to always bind to a string (given the particular sample data of
the example). In the second use case, the PartiQL variable `y` was
always bound to an array (again, given the particular sample data of the
example).

To make the case for variables that bind to different types, consider
the following twist in the `employeesNest` data set. Some of the
elements of the `projects` array are plain strings and some are
tuples. Even the employee tuples do not always have the same attributes.

```{include=tutorial/code/q11.env}
```

This query on `hr.employeesMixed2` produces employee name -- employee
project pairs.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q11.sql}
```

Notice the sub-expression `(p IS TUPLE)`. The `IS` operator can be used
to check a value against it's type at evaluation time.
Notice also that the variable `p` binds to different types.

In general, the `FROM` clause of a query binds its variables (aliases)
to data. The variables need not bind to data that have the same
types. Each binding is fed to the `SELECT` clause, which evaluates its
expressions.

This table shows each variables' binding produced by the `FROM` clause
and the corresponding tuple output by the `SELECT` clause.

# Accessing Array Elements by Order


SQL allows us to order the output of a query using the `ORDER BY`
clause. However, the SQL data model does not recognize order in the
input data. In contrast, many of the new data formats feature arrays;
the array's elements have an order. We may want to find an array element
according to its order, or, we may want to find the positions of certain
elements in their arrays.

`<Array> [<number>]`
------------------------

Let's consider again the dataset `hr.employeesNest`.

```{include=tutorial/code/q12.env}
```

The `projects` attribute is an array of tuples; that is, each tuple
has an ordinal associated with it. The following query returns each
employee name, along with the first project of the employee.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q12.sql}
```
The query returns 

```{include=tutorial/code/q12.output}
```

## Multistep Paths

Technically, the structure `[<number>]` is a kind of path step.
For example, notice the 4-step path `e.projects[0].name`. When `e`
is bound to the first tuple of `hr.employeesNest`, then the path
`e.projects` results into the array

```
[ 
    { 'name': 'AWS Redshift Spectrum querying' },
    { 'name': 'AWS Redshift security' },
    { 'name': 'AWS Aurora security' }
]
```

Consequently applying the `[0]` step on `e.projects` (that is,
evaluating `e.projects[0]`) leads to `{'name': 'AWS Redshift
Spectrum querying'}`. Finally, evaluating the `.name` step on
`e.projects[0]` (that is, evaluating `e.projects[0].name`) leads
to `'AWS Redshift Spectrum querying'`.

## Finding the Order of Each Element in an Array

Let's assume that the order of each employee's projects in the
`projects` attribute of `hr.employeesNest` matters. The first
project is the employee's highest priority project, followed by the
second and so on. The following query finds the names of each employee
involved in a security project, the security project and its order in
the `projects` array.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q13.sql}
```

Notice the new feature: `AT o`. While `p` ranges over the elements
of the array `e.projects`, the variable `o` takes as value the
ordinal number of the element in the array. The query returns

```{include=tutorial/code/q13.output}
```

# Pivoting & Unpivoting

Many queries need to range over and collect the attribute name/value
pairs of tuples or the key/value pairs of maps.

## Unpivoting Tuples

Consider this dataset that provides the closing prices of multiple
ticker symbols.

```{include=tutorial/code/q14.env}
```

The following query unpivots the stock ticker/price pairs.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q14.sql}
```
Notice the use of `"` in this query. The double quotes allow us to
disambiquate from `date` the keyword and `"date"` the identifier. Also
double quote specify case sensitivity for attribute lookups.


The query returns 

```{include=tutorial/code/q14.output}
```

Unpivoting tuples enables the use of attribute names as if they were
data. For example, it becomes easy to compute the average price for each
symbol as

```sql
SELECT sym AS "symbol", 
       AVG(price) AS avgPrice
FROM closingPrices c, 
     UNPIVOT c AS price AT sym
WHERE NOT sym = 'date'
GROUP BY sym
```

which returns 

```
<<
  {
    'symbol': 'amzn',
    'avgPrice': 1901
  },
  {
    'symbol': 'fb',
    'avgPrice': 181.5
  },
  {
    'symbol': 'goog',
    'avgPrice': 1119.5
  }
>>
--- 
OK! (31 ms)
```

## Pivoting into Tuples

Pivoting turns a collection into a tuple. For example, consider the
collection

```{include=tutorial/code/q15.env}
```

Then the following `PIVOT` query 

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q15.sql}
```

produces the tuple

```{include=tutorial/code/q15.output}
```

Notice that the `PIVOT` query looks like a `SELECT-FROM-WHERE-...`
query except that instead of a `SELECT` clause it has a `PIVOT
<value expression> AT <attribute expression>`. Note also that the
`PIVOT` query does not return a singleton collection of tuples: Rather
it literally returns a tuple value.

## Use Case: Pivoting Subqueries

(This example also uses the grouping features of PartiQL, Creating
Nested Results with `GROUP BY` ... `GROUP AS`.)

Let us generalize the previous case of pivoting. We have a table of
stock prices

```{include=tutorial/code/q16.env}
```

and we want to pivot it into a collection of tuples, where each tuple
has all the `symbol:price` pairs for a date, as follows

```{include=tutorial/code/q16.output}
```

The following query first creates one group datesPrices for each date.
Then the `PIVOT` subquery pivots the group into the tuple prices.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q16.sql}
```

For example, the `datesPrices` collection, returned from `GROUP AS` for
`sp.date = date(4/1/2019)` is

```
    'datesPrices': <<
      {
        'sp': {
          'date': '4/1/2019',
          'symbol': 'amzn',
          'price': 1900
        }
      },
      {
        'sp': {
          'date': '4/1/2019',
          'symbol': 'goog',
          'price': 1120
        }
      },
      {
        'sp': {
          'date': '4/1/2019',
          'symbol': 'fb',
          'price': 180
        }
      }
    >>
```

# Creating Nested and Non-SQL Results

PartiQL allows queries that create nested results as well as queries
that create heterogeneous results.

## Creating Nested Results with `SELECT VALUE` Queries

Let's consider again the dataset `hr.employeesNestScalars`:

```{include=tutorial/code/q17.env}
```

The following query outputs each tuple of `hr.employeesNestScalars`,
except that instead of all projects each tuple has only the security
projects of the employee. The important new feature here is the
`SELECT VALUE <expression>`.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q17.sql}
```

The result is

```{include=tutorial/code/q17.output}
```

A `SELECT VALUE <expression>` query (or subquery, as in this
example) returns a collection of whatever the `<expression>`
evaluates to.

Notice the difference from SQL's `SELECT`, which always produces
tuples. If a SQL `SELECT` appears as a subquery, then the context of
the subquery designates whether the subquery's result should be coerced
into a scalar (e.g., when `5 = <subquery>`), coerced into a
collection of scalars (e.g., when `5 IN <subquery>`), etc. None of
this applies to `SELECT VALUE`, which produces a collection and this
collection is not coerced.

## Creating Nested Results with `GROUP BY ... GROUP AS`

Another pattern of creating nested results in PartiQL is via the `GROUP
AS` extension to SQL's `GROUP BY`. This pattern is more efficient and
more intuitive than the use of nested `SELECT VALUE` queries when the
required nesting is not following the nesting of the input. (The example
in [Creating Nested Results with `SELECT VALUE` Queries](#creating-nested-results-with-select-value-queries) is one where
the nesting in the output follows the nesting of the input and, thus, an
intuitive solution does not involve `GROUP BY`.)

The following query outputs each security project found in
`hr.employeesNestScalars` along with the list of employee names that
work on the project.

```{.sql include=tutorial/code/q18.sql}
```

The result is

```{include=tutorial/code/q18.output}
```

The `GROUP AS` generalizes SQL's `GROUP BY` by making the formulated
groups available in their entirety to the query's `SELECT` and
`HAVING` clauses. Contrast with SQL's `GROUP BY`, where the
`SELECT` and `HAVING` clauses can have aggregate functions over
grouped columns but they cannot get access to the individual values of
the grouped columns.

To better understand the workings of `GROUP BY ... GROUP AS` it is
best to think of PartiQL queries as a pipeline of clauses, starting with
the `FROM`, continuing with the `GROUP BY` and finishing with the
`SELECT`. Each clause is a function that inputs data and outputs data.
In that sense, the `GROUP BY ... GROUP AS` is a function that inputs
the result of the `FROM` and outputs its result to the `SELECT`.

The following query (conceptually) produces the output of the `FROM`
clause.

```sql
SELECT e AS e, p AS p
FROM hr.employeesNestScalars AS e JOIN e.projects AS p ON p LIKE '%security%'
```

We see that the `FROM` delivers the collection of tuples consisting of
an employee `e` and a project `p` that were output by the `FROM`
clause, i.e., the `LEFT JOIN`. This is alike SQL's `FROM` semantics.

Then the `GROUP BY ... GROUP AS ...` can be thought of as outputting a
table that has one column for each group-by expression (i.e., each
security project `p`) and a last column `perProjectGroup` whose
value (conceptually) is the collection of employee/project `e`/`p`
tuples that correspond to the group-by expression `p`. Thus the
`GROUP BY ... GROUP AS ...` output is the table

Finally the `SELECT` clause inputs the above and outputs the query
result.
