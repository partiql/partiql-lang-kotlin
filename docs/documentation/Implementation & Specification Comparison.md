# `partiql-lang-kotlin` compared to the PartiQL Specification

This document outlines the ways in which the `partiql-lang-kotlin` reference implementation conforms and diverges from
the [PartiQL specification](https://partiql.org/assets/PartiQL-Specification.pdf).
Also included are some features that are part of the Kotlin implementation but are not yet formally defined in the 
PartiQL spec.

## Features defined in spec

Caveats:

* ^1 `partiql-lang-kotlin` does not support the "type checking mode" defined in section [4.1 of the spec](https://partiql.org/assets/PartiQL-Specification.pdf#subsection.4.1), which errors on operations with wrongly-typed data. It does have a “LEGACY” mode which offers stricter type-checking support than “PERMISSIVE” mode but does not follow all of the type-checking behavior. See this comment in [CompileOptions.kt](https://github.com/partiql/partiql-lang-kotlin/blob/2f13823863032bd2309fc1f9605b97604474435f/lang/src/org/partiql/lang/eval/CompileOptions.kt#L48-L76) for more information on `LEGACY` mode.
